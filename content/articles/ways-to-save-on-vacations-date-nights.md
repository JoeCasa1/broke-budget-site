If you are living paycheck to paycheck or deeply in debt I suggest cutting all unnecessary costs from your budget. This includes the costs of going on dates with your significant other. It also includes reducing the costs involved in the vacation that you take each year. How much money you save really depends on how focused you are on putting savings in your bank account or paying off your debt.

I understand that we all need to have some time with our partner or to get away from the stress of life by going on a vacation. If you want to be super intense until you reach your financial goals I suggest cutting out going on vacations altogether. Then reducing dates to things that don’t require money. Once you reach your financial goals be sure to take some time for yourself and your family.

If you still feel the need to go on vacation here are some of my tips for saving money:

1. Consider going on a day trip to your nearest attraction instead of a week-long trip. This can save you money on overnight hotel/resort stays.
2. Consider vacationing at home. Take a few days to renew your mind at home. Get some well-needed rest and relaxation without leaving your home.
3. Have a spa day at home. Buy some refreshing face masks, lotions, and bubble bath soap at the grocery or convenience store. Spend the day exchanging massages with your significant other. Invite some friends over to have a girl’s spa day, or simply treat yourself with the products.
4. Consider the differences in the cost of driving versus flying. Choose the one that best fits your financial goals. Make sure you include the vehicle gas cost for driving.
5. Consider visiting the cheaper states for a vacation. Instead of the more popular expensive areas.

If you want to go on some cheap or free dates with your significant other here are some ideas:

1. Go for a picnic by a lake or on a nearby beach. Maybe even bring some swimsuits, towels, and sunscreen for a full day of fun.
2. Make a fort or a comfy spot to lay down to watch some romantic movies. Go all out with string lights or candles. Include some favorite snacks or a favorite meal. This can be done inside or outside.
3. Go stargazing in your backyard or at a park.
4. Go for a walk around the neighborhood or a park.
5. Bring out some 2 player card games, video games, or trivia questions. Spend time talking and competing in the games.

There are many ways to spend time with your family and take time for yourself. Both are needed in life but you don’t want your activities to affect your financial situation. I encourage you to get creative with how you save on dates and on vacations. Once you reach your goals of saving or paying off debt be sure to spend a little on a vacation or treat your significant other with a more expensive date. Money is there to serve our needs and our wants when used responsibly.
